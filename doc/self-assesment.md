Self-assessment

**Name of project to be reviewed: air-combat-3**

**Names of reviewers: Aarni Kolehmainen, Joona Viheriä, Henrik Granö, Waleed Ifthikar**

Provide short comments (2-4 sentences) for each item below.

## 1. Overall design and functionality (0-6p)

  * 1.1: The implementation corresponds to the selected topic and
scope. The extent of project is large enough to accommodate work for
everyone (2p)

Implementation corresponds to topic. Project is large enough but does not 
have many extra features.



  * 1.2: The software structure is appropriate, clear and well
documented. e.g. class structure is justified, inheritance used where
appropriate, information hiding is implemented as appropriate. (2p)

Clear but could be more modular, does not contain many comments where perhaps
necessary. Code cleaning might be necessary.



  * 1.3: Use of external libraries is justified and well documented. (2p)

SFML and Box2D are used as needed.



## 2. Working practices (0-6p)

  * 2.1: Git is used appropriately (e.g., commits are logical and
frequent enough, commit logs are descriptive). (2 p)

Git is used appropriately in correct tense.



  * 2.2: Work is distributed and organised well. Everyone contributes to
the project and has a relevant role that matches his/her skills. The
distribution of roles is described well enough. (2p)

Most of the work was done in group meetings and worked well. The tasks were
mostly divided.



  * 2.3: Quality assurance is appropriate. Implementation is tested
comprehensively and those testing principles are well documented. (2p)

Testing was comprehensive after each feature added to make sure everything works.

## 3. Implementation aspects (0-8p)

  * 3.1: Building the software is easy and well documented. CMake or
such tool is highly recommended. (2p)

Makefile is provided but full functionality is guaranteed with CodeBlocks on Windows.


  * 3.2: Memory management is robust, well-organised and
coherent. E.g., smart pointers are used where appropriate or RO3/5 is
followed. The memory management practices should be documented. (2p)

All allocated memory is deleted.


  * 3.3: C++ standard library is used where appropriate. For example,
containers are used instead of own solutions where it makes sense. (2
p)
Vectors and other C++ containers are used when needed.


  * 3.4: Implementation works robustly also in exceptional
situations. E.g., functions can survive invalid inputs and exception
handling is used where appropriate. (2p)

One exception is left uncaught.

## 4. Project extensiveness (0-10p)

  * Project contains features beyond the minimal requirements: Most of
the projects list additional features which can be implemented for
more points. Teams can also suggest their own custom features, though
they have to be in the scope of the project and approved by the course
assistant who is overseeing the project. (0-10p)

All basic requirements are done, due to lack of time less features than planned 
are implemented.
