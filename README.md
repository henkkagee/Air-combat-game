# Air Combat, dogfighting game

Simple 2D dogfighting game. C++, SFML & Box2D used.

## IMPORTANT Note for building

There are two precompiled versions of Box2D available under src/Box2D/Build/bin/x86_64/Debug, one for windows and one for linux. These are used in the makefile. If neither of them work, you may have to build Box2D yourself, instructions for this are available in the src/Box2D directory.

Instructions for building on Linux:

 * navigate to /src

 * `make all`

 * `make compile`

 * `./a.out`
